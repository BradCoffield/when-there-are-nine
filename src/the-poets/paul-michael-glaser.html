        Paul Michael Glaser, one of the more recognizable faces in popular culture from the
        20 th  Century, has spent much of his time in recent years devoted to his exploration of
        digital formats and creative processes, developing a style uniquely his own. Abstracts,
        body-forms, and portraits are represented in his collections, as are the creatures and
        every-day objects that draw in the eye for their colors, unique digital “brush” work and
        other worldliness.

        Glaser’s artworks are difficult to categorize, but easy to appreciate, and their digital
        derivation gives them a contemporary, even cutting-edge presence and appeal.

        art published under the title, <em>The Edge of Whimsy</em> (available at www.pmglaserart.com).”
