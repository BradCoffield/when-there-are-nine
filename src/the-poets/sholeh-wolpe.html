    Sholeh Wolpé is an Iranian-born poet, playwright and librettist. About her poems, the Poetry Foundation
    writes, “Wolpé’s concise, unflinching, and often wry free verse explores violence, culture, and
    gender.” Named a “2020-2021 Cultural Trailblazer” by the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs,
    Wolpé is the recipient of the 2014 PEN/Heim, 2013 Midwest Book Award, 2010 Lois Roth Persian Translation
    prize as well as artist fellowships and residencies in the U.S., Mexico, Spain, Australia and Switzerland. Her
    most recent books include <em>Keeping Time With Blue Hyacinth</em> (Univ. of Arkansas Press), and <em>
        The Conference of
        the Birds
    </em> (W.W. Norton). Wolpé’s literary work numbers over twelve collections of poetry, books of
    translations, and anthologies, as well as several plays. She has performed her literary work with world-
    renowned musicians nationally and internationally.  She has taught poetry and literary translation at UCLA
    and the University of Maine’s Stonecoast MFA program, and is presently the Writer-in-Residence at
    University of California, Irvine. She is presently working on an oratorio, The Conference of the Birds, with
