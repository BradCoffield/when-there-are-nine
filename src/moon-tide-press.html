<p>Moon Tide Press was founded in 2006 by journalist and poet Michael Miller. For a
decade, the press published full-length collections, anthologies, and featured a Poet of
the Month on their website—always bringing new and necessary voices to the forefront
of the Southern California poetry scene and beyond.​</p>
<p>In January 2017, Moon Tide Press was passed on to Eric Morago, who has taken over
as its new publisher and editor-in-chief. Eric continues to build on Miller&#39;s successful
publishing history and has brought the press into a new and exciting future.​</p>
<p>Moon Tide Press will continue to focus on new, diverse, and/or daring voices.  We are
in search of well-crafted poetry that is smart, imaginative, honest, and engaging—poetry
that invites its audience to come back for seconds and thirds.</p>
<p>If this sounds like the poetry you write, consider submitting to us. If this sounds like the
poetry you enjoy reading, please browse our titles, follow us on social media, and stay
tuned for our future authors.</p>
